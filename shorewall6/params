#
# Shorewall6 -- /etc/shorewall6/params
#
# Assign any variables that you need here.
#
# It is suggested that variable names begin with an upper case letter
# to distinguish them from variables used internally within the
# Shorewall6 programs
#
# Example:
#
#	NET_IF=eth0
#	NET_OPTIONS=dhcp,nosmurfs
#
# Example (/etc/shorewall6/interfaces record):
#
#	net	$NET_IF		-	$NET_OPTIONS
#
# The result will be the same as if the record had been written
#
#	net	eth0		-	dhcp,nosmurfs
